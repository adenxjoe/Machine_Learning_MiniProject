# Crop Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to help farmers predict the most suitable crop for their land based on various conditions such as soil type, weather, soil pH, and other relevant factors. The system uses four different machine learning algorithms to make predictions, and the one with the highest accuracy is presented to the user.

## The project includes:

A user interface for farmers to input their land conditions.
Machine learning models to predict the best crop.
Evaluation of models to determine the most accurate one.
Display of the prediction and the used algorithm to the farmer.
Project Structure
template/: Contains the HTML template files for the project.
style/: Contains CSS and images used in the project.
project/: Contains the main project files, including the machine learning models and the Flask application.

## Features

User Input Interface: Farmers can input land conditions through an easy-to-use interface.
Machine Learning Models: Includes Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN algorithms for prediction.
Model Evaluation: Automatically evaluates and selects the most accurate model.
Result Display: Shows the best crop prediction and the algorithm used to the user.
