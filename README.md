#Crop Prediction Using Machine Learning

#Overview
This project aims to help farmers predict the most suitable crop for their land based on various conditions such as soil type, weather, soil pH, and other relevant factors. The system uses four different machine learning algorithms to make predictions, and the one with the highest accuracy is presented to the user.

The project includes:

A user interface for farmers to input their land conditions.
Machine learning models to predict the best crop.
Evaluation of models to determine the most accurate one.
Display of the prediction and the used algorithm to the farmer.
Project Structure
template/: Contains the HTML template files for the project.
static/: Contains CSS and images used in the project.
data/: Contains the CSV file with historical crop data.
project/: Contains the main project files, including the machine learning models and the Flask application.
Features
User Input Interface: Farmers can input land conditions through an easy-to-use interface.
Machine Learning Models: Includes Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN algorithms for prediction.
Model Evaluation: Automatically evaluates and selects the most accurate model.
Result Display: Shows the best crop prediction and the algorithm used to the user.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop-prediction-ml.git
cd crop-prediction-ml
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare the data: Ensure the crop_data.csv file is present in the data/ directory with the necessary historical data.

Run the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
python project/app.py
Access the application: Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Input land conditions: Use the provided form to input soil type, weather conditions, soil pH, etc.

Get the prediction: The application will display the most suitable crop and the algorithm used for the prediction.
